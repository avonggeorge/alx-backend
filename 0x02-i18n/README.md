# i18n

"I18n" stands for "internationalization." It is a process of designing and developing software or applications in a way that makes it easy to adapt to different languages and regions without requiring significant changes to the core code. The term "i18n" comes from the fact that there are 18 letters between the "i" and the "n" in the word "internationalization." The goal of i18n is to ensure that a product can support multiple languages and cultural norms, making it more accessible to a global audience.
